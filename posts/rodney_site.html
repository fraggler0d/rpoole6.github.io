		<h1>Hello everyone</h1>
		
		<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></h2>
		<p> I chose the website, Reddit for the site that interests me. The reason I chose this site isn't because of
		its design or anything like that, because the design is pretty bland in comparison to other websites. I chose Reddit because,
		there are so many things you can learn about or use the site for; whether you're finding a new hobby or finding a subreddit
		filled with others who share the same interests as you. My main fascination with the site is the amount of "subreddits" it 
		possesses; a seemingly infinite number that grows everyday. I find myself going to Reddit at least once a day, and maybe if
		you check it out, you might start to, as well.</p>
