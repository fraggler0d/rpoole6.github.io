		<h1>Hey everybody,</h1>
		
		<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></h2>
		<p> The website I chose to write about for this assignment is Reddit. Reddit isn't
		as flashy as a lot of other websites, but that's not the main reason I find it appealing.
		This is one of my favorite sites, because for a first time visitor, it doesn't look like much,
		but once you begin to go through the different subreddits, you find a resource for nearly
		anything; from your favorite hobbies to worldwide news, Reddit has it all, and it often has
		people who are experts in whatever the subject is, that are also users, and more often than not,
		they are eager to talk or help. If you've never heard of it before, I encourage you to check it out
		you may end up liking Reddit as much as I do when you're finished.</p>
